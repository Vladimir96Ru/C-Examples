        1. Armstrong

        Determine all Armstrong numbers in the interval [a, b]. The Armstrong 
        number is the number equal to the sum of its digits to the power of 
        their number. For example: 153 = 1^3 + 5^3 + 3^3.

        2. EPS

        Let Yo = 0; Yk = (Y(k-1)+1) / (Y(k-1)+2), k = 1, 2, ... Real eps is 
        given (0 < eps << 1).
        Find the first term of Yn for which /Yn - Yn - 1/ < eps.

        3. Couples

        Write a university bell scheduling program that displays the start time 
        by pair number, the end of this pair and a five-minute break within the
        pair.

        4. Operand

        To solve the following problems, first use the conditional statement, 
        and then change the program so that to get the result using 
        conditional operation. Calculate the value of a function using first 
        the conditional operator and then the conditional operator.

        5. Shift
        
        In character array A[N] rotate by K < N elements to the right. 
        The last K elements are then moved to the first K positions.

        6. NxM
        Given integers a1, a2, ..., an, an integer matrix of order nxm (m >= 6).
        Get an n x (m+1) matrix by inserting a column of numbers into the 
        original matrix a1, a2, ..., an in the middle.
